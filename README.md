# Converter from IGC files to KMZ Files

This is just a simple converter which reads IGC files and converts them into
a format which can be read by google maps. The output is a trajectory with a colored
uplift.

If I find some time, I'd like to add a XC-Task calculator or some more analysis to the data.
